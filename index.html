                <hr>
                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">I had visited here on October 12th 2021</h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left"> The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel,[14] and is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3 million visitors annually.[15] It has made many appearances in popular culture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 160 metres (525 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 167 metres (548 ft) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel".[16]

The London Eye used to offer the highest public viewing point in London[17] until it was superseded by the 245-metre-high (804 ft)[18] observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013.[19]

The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth. The nearest tube station is Westminster, 420 metres (1,378 ft) away.[20]

                <hr>
                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">I had visited here on 23rd August 2017</h5>
                <p class="text-muted text-left"> The Giraffe Centre is located in Lang'ata, approximately 20 kilometres from the centre of Nairobi, Kenya. It was established in order to protect engangered species of giraffe found only in the grasslands of East Africa.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1979, the Giraffe Center, a nature sanctuary for visiting and including wildlife conservation education for urban school children, was started by Jock Leslie Melville, the Kenyan grandson of a Scottish Earl, when he and his wife Betty captured two baby giraffe to start a programme of breeding giraffe on their Langata property, site of the present Centre. Since then the programme has had huge success, resulting in the introduction of several breeding pairs of Rothschild Giraffe into Kenyan national parks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By 1983 enough money had been raised to establish the Giraffe Visitor's Center as a tourist destination just outside Nairobi.

The main attraction for both school children and visitors is feeding giraffes from a raised observation platform. The Giraffe Center is also home to several warthogs which freely roam the area along with the giraffes.

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or youâ€™ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battle.
